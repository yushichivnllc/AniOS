/**
 * Which physical keys are held down, for the on-screen keyboard to draw.
 *
 * The OSK shows what it types; this is what lets it also show what the real
 * keyboard is doing. `scripts/keyboard/key_monitor.py` reads /dev/input and
 * prints one keycode per event - the same evdev codes the OSK's own keys carry
 * for ydotool, so a code off the wire lines up with a drawn key directly.
 *
 * IT RUNS ONLY WHILE THE OSK IS ON SCREEN. `watching` is the OSK's own open
 * state, and nothing else may set it: a reader of every key on the machine is
 * a keylogger unless its lifetime is exactly the window in which the user
 * asked to see their keys drawn. It also holds no history - `pressed` is what
 * is DOWN, and a key leaves the set the moment it comes up - and it carries
 * keycodes rather than characters, so nothing here knows what was typed.
 *
 * Feature-detected the way Clight and Tailscale are: reading /dev/input needs
 * membership of the `input` group and nothing else, and a machine without it
 * gets `available: false` and an OSK that simply does not highlight. The shell
 * asks for no privilege it does not already have.
