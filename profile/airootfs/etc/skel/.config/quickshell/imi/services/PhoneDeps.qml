/**
 * What the Phone tab's optional tooling looks like on this machine
 * (docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-27-phone-tab-design.md, W3).
 *
 * Nothing here is an installer dependency: scrcpy, adb, DroidCam, the
 * v4l2loopback module, pactl, avahi-browse and the preview players are all
 * probed with a constant `command -v` at construction
 * (tests/lint_capability_probe_gating.py is why every probe starts itself),
 * and `missingFor(feature)` turns the flags into the install guide's rows -
 * one per missing dependency, with the sibling fork's per-distro commands
 * verbatim. `recheck()` re-runs every probe, which is what the guide's
 * Re-check button and a finished install script call.
 *
 * A tool has THREE states here, not two. `command -v` answers presence; the
 * three binaries the tab spawns - scrcpy, adb and droidcam-cli - are then
 * actually STARTED, because a package linked against a library the system has
 * moved past is on PATH and dies before main, and a flag that says "present"
 * for it is a card that reads `ready` and does nothing when clicked. See
 * `parseLoaderFailure` for the measurement.
 *
 * It also owns the two commands that CHANGE what adb can see - `adb pair` and
 * `adb connect`, both constant argv - and the avahi lookup that finds the
 * two ports Android re-rolls on every toggle, because every other adb fact
 * the tab has is already answered here.
 *
 * The dependency table and the feature -> dependency mapping between the
 * sync markers are kept byte-for-byte in sync with the logic-only double
 * (tests/imports/testservices/PhoneDeps.qml);
 * tests/test_phone_sessions_contract.py enforces it.
