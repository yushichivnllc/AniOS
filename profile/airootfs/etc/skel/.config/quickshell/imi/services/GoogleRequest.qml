/**
 * Authenticated calls to a Google API, one at a time: curl with
 * GoogleAccount's bearer token. The token, the method and the JSON body
 * travel to curl through a config document on stdin (`-K -`), never as
 * argv - argv is readable by every process on the machine.
 *
 * Calls queue behind one another (PhoneConnect's action queue shape): a
 * second `request()` while one is in flight waits its turn instead of
 * being dropped or re-pointing the one running. Each finishes with
 * (json, error, status, tag) - the tag is whatever the caller queued, so
 * a calendar's identity rides with its own request rather than sitting
 * on this object as mutable state.
