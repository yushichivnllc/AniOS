/**
 * Wallpaper Engine compatibility verdicts - the reference app's
 * (jagrat7/linux-wallpaper-engine) bulk compatibility scanner, on this
 * shell's architecture: the scan runs in a SPAWNED `qs -p` scanner process
 * (scripts/wallpapers/we_compat_scan.qml) loading each project into a real
 * WallpaperEngineSurface, so one wallpaper that wedges or crashes the
 * renderer kills the scanner and not the shell; this service owns the queue,
 * respawns the scanner past the corpse, and records the verdicts.
 *
 * The store is its own raw-JSON file on the PluginState pattern (runtime
 * project ids, so never a JsonAdapter), and deliberately NOT the overrides
 * store: verdicts are scan-managed state, not user settings - the
 * reference's SCAN_MANAGED_KEYS split, as a file boundary.
 *
 * Decisions live in services/we_compat.js (tst_we_compat.qml drives them);
 * this file owns the disk and the process.
