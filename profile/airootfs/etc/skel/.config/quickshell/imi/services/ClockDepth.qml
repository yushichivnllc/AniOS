 * What the subject-mask cache holds for the wallpaper that is on screen.
 *
 * The shell never computes a cache key. scripts/background/subject_mask.py owns
 * the derivation (path, mtime and size) and this asks it; a second
 * implementation in QML would be two things that must agree, with nothing
 * reporting it when they stop - which is the `activeStill` shape.
 *
 * `status` is stdlib-only and loads no model, so a query costs a ~35ms process
 * spawn and never reaches ONNX Runtime. `runModel` is the only thing that loads
 * one, it costs seconds and a gigabyte, and it is reachable only from the
 * wallpaper selector's picker - nothing reactive here can start a run.
 *
 * Nothing runs at all until either `background.clockDepth.enable` (default
 * false) or the picker is open, so a machine that has never used depth pays
 * nothing for it, and neither does a wallpaper that has no mask once it is on.
