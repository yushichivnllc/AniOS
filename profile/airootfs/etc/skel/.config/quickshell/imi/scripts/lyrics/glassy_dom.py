"""Word-synced lyrics straight out of GlassyMusic's BetterLyrics DOM.

The better-lyrics plugin renders full richsync inside the app - every
`.blyrics--word` span carries data-time and data-duration - and that data
exists nowhere else this machine can reach (the upstream source sits behind
a Cloudflare Turnstile token). With the app launched with
--remote-debugging-port=9222 (~/.config/glassy-music-flags.conf), this
client reads it over CDP.

Fails soft by design: no port, no page, no websockets module, or a track
mismatch all return None - the provider chain just moves on to unison and
lrclib. The track GUARD matters: CDP answers whatever tab is playing, and
lyrics for the wrong song are worse than none.
