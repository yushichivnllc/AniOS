"""scrcpy session supervisor for the Phone tab (services/PhoneScrcpy.qml).

One long-lived process speaking NDJSON on stdin/stdout. QML holds no scrcpy
process handles: it sends commands and reads events, and this supervisor owns
every scrcpy child, its window title and its exit.

Commands (one JSON object per line on stdin):
  {"cmd": "launch", "id": <session id>, "type": "mirror"|"app",
   "target_args": [...], "extra_args": [...]}
  {"cmd": "stop", "id": <session id>}
  {"cmd": "stop_all"}
  {"cmd": "focus", "id": <session id>}
  {"cmd": "list_apps", "target_args": [...], "deviceId": <cache key>}

Events (one JSON object per line on stdout):
  started    {id, pid, title[, alreadyRunning]}
  exited     {id, code, error}          error = scrcpy's last stderr line
  error      {id, message}
  apps_list  {deviceId, apps[, cached]} apps = [{package, name, system}]
  apps_error {message}

Every scrcpy child is spawned as
  scrcpy [-s <serial>] --window-title=imi-phone-<type>-<id> <extra_args...>
so that `focus` can address the window by its title and nothing else. The
`-s` target is resolved from `adb devices` on every launch: a USB serial the
caller names and adb lists wins outright, then any USB serial (no ":" in it)
over any ip:port, and only when adb lists nothing do the caller's target_args
stand. Among several USB devices the pick is sorted, not adb's print order. A
wireless target the caller names is `adb connect`ed first, bounded, so a phone
on wireless debugging that adb has not seen yet still resolves.

stdin closing means the shell went away; every session is stopped then, so a
shell restart never leaves headless scrcpy windows behind.

        `PhoneScrcpy.stopManager()` sets `running = false`, which Quickshell
        sends as SIGTERM, and Python's default handler exits the process
        without running `stop_all()` - so every mirror and every app window
        the supervisor owned was orphaned. Measured: the child was still
        alive a second after the supervisor was gone.

        The signal is re-raised through the default handler afterwards, so
        the exit status still says what killed it. Called from `main`,
        because `signal.signal` only works on the main thread.
