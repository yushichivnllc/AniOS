/**
 * How an element joins the frame, and how it lets go.
 *
 * Frame mode's premise is that the shell is one surface: a border around the
 * screen with the bar, the dock and eventually every other edge surface as
 * parts of it rather than islands over it. An element that can leave that
 * surface has to leave it the way a drop leaves water - holding on, thinning,
 * letting go, and ringing afterwards - and come back the same way. This is
 * that join, once, for whoever needs it.
 *
 * The consumer owns its own geometry. This owns the physics
 * (`functions/fluid.js`) and draws the neck between the two:
 *
 *     FrameJoin {
 *         id: join
 *         anchors.fill: parent      // the element's own box
 *         plate: myPlate            // the painted shape that joins the frame
 *         edge: "bottom"            // which side of the screen the band is on
 *         attached: Config...       // asked to be part of the frame
 *         travel: Appearance.sizes.hyprlandGapsOut
 *         bandInset: restOutwardMargin
 *     }
 *     // ...and the plate reads back:
 *     //   join.lift        px away from the band
 *     //   join.press       px across it: negative squashed, positive stretched
 *     //   join.fused       whether anything still bridges the two
 *     //   join.drawsPlate  the field is painting the plate; the plate's own
 *     //                    Rectangle stands down
 *
 * The field itself is FrameJoinField, and it need not be drawn HERE: with
 * `paintsLocally` off the join keeps the physics and the consumer publishes
 * what the field needs to whichever surface should paint it - the frame's,
 * so the plate and the band are one outline (frame-one-surface.md, stage 2).
