// The bar popup card's height, as arithmetic.
//
// Nothing about that card is reachable from a test: it lives on a
// wlr-layer-shell surface, which qmltestrunner cannot build and headless weston
// does not implement, so the decisions have to be somewhere a test can call
// them - the same reason ParallaxMath.sampleOrigin and clockDepth.js are pure.
//
// The card runs on ONE scalar, `openProgress`, 0 while idle and 1 while open.
// The fade rides it and so does the height, which is why the height is a plain
// binding rather than a second animation: a Behavior whose target moves every
// frame restarts every frame and never ticks
// (b710ef731 ("fix(plugins): stop the position Behavior swallowing the parallax
// cancellation")), and two animations of one quantity are two timings that have
// to agree.

// The card opens at the height of the content's FIRST drawn section and unfurls
// from there, instead of appearing at full height or growing out of nothing:
// the top edge never moves and the primary content is legible on frame one.
//
// A section is measured at its DRAWN height. A Layout child states its size
// through `Layout.preferredHeight` and carries no implicit height of its own,
// so reading `implicitHeight` here answers 0 for exactly the popups whose first
// section is a card - which is every popup the unroll exists for. Zero-height
// and undrawn children are skipped rather than accepted, for the same reason a
// stagger ranks by visible position: a spacer that spends a slot would make the
// hero the height of nothing.

// Opening with a hero that is the whole content (a one-section popup) leaves
// rest === open, so such a popup simply has no unroll rather than a special
// case. Leaving, or opening with no measurable first section, the rest is the
// small square parked on the widget the card belongs to - the card grows out of
// and collapses back into the bar, which is what it did before the unroll and
// is still the honest answer when there is no section to open at.
// `fused`: the card is joined to the frame's band (frame-pin-grammar.md),
// and a fused card has no rest to park at - it grows out of the band from
// nothing and submerges back into it to nothing. The parked square and the
// hero row are the free card's rests.

// An idle card must be exactly 0 tall, because an `opacity: 0` card still
// publishes a full-size input region and a permanently-reachable one on a
// screen-sized Overlay surface eats every click in its rectangle. The height is
// derived, so emptying the region means emptying what it is derived FROM: a
// zero open height is 0 at every progress, including a progress the exit's
// curve has undershot below zero.
//
// The top end is deliberately NOT clamped: the spatial tier overshoots past 1,
// and a card that overshoots its content and settles back is the tier's own
// expressiveness - the same overshoot the height Behavior this replaced already
// produced.

// The three-channel section entrance, shared by every popup whose
// below-the-fold sections cascade in once the card has arrived
// (docs/p3drovfx-motion-measured-2026-08-22.md §3: opacity, a scale from
// ~0.85, and a small rise - not a fade). One `appear` scalar drives all three
// so they cannot land on different schedules; opacity IS that scalar and needs
// no helper, these two are the other channels.
//
// The scale's excursion is DERIVED from the rise over the section's own width
// rather than fixed - EditModeDrawer.qml derives its rows' the same way and
// says why: the measured 0.85 is a compact popup card's, and the same factor
// on a wide row is a horizontal swing that reads as a zoom, not a settle. The
// measured 0.85 stays as the floor so a narrow section cannot invert the
// derivation, and a section asked before its first layout pass (width 0, or
// no width at all) takes the floor rather than dividing into nothing.
