/**
 * Controls for a region recording, parked against the rectangle being captured.
 *
 * A region recording gives no sign of itself inside the frame - which is the
 * point, but it leaves stopping the capture as a trip to the bar. This puts
 * stop, pause and (while the replay buffer is armed) save-clip beside the
 * region, for as long as the recording runs.
 *
 * Built from the same pieces as the region selector's own toolbar - `Toolbar`,
 * `IconToolbarButton`, `ToolbarPairedFab` - so it is the shell's M3 expressive
 * toolbar rather than a pill with icons in it: 56dp container on the surface
 * container role, full corner, its own shadow, 22dp icons in 40dp targets, and
 * the destructive action separated out as a paired FAB the way the selector
 * separates its close.
 *
 * No tooltips on these buttons, deliberately. A StyledToolTip is a Controls
 * Popup, and a Popup renders in the overlay of the window it belongs to - which
 * here is a window the exact size of the toolbar. The tooltip has nowhere to go
 * except on top of the buttons, it arrives with no delay, and while it is up it
 * takes the pointer: arrow cursor, clicks swallowed. The selector's toolbar gets
 * away with tooltips because its window is the whole screen and they have room
 * above. If these controls ever need labels, they need a surface of their own.
 *
 * The window is exactly the size of the controls and sits OUTSIDE the region.
 * gsr records whatever the compositor shows inside the rectangle, so anything
 * drawn over it would be in every frame of a clip that cannot be re-taken -
 * see recording_region.js, which refuses to place the toolbar at all rather
 * than place it inside.
