// How much of a screen the cheatsheet's window may take, and how far a page
// that is too big for that has to shrink.
//
// The window is a fixed-size toplevel (equal minimum and maximum hints are what
// make Hyprland float and centre it, see Cheatsheet.qml), so it never resizes
// itself: it is exactly as big as the page it is showing. Its pages therefore
// have to fit the screen on their own, and "the screen" is the part of it the
// compositor leaves - `hyprctl monitors` reports the reserved area the bar and
// the dock hold as [left, top, right, bottom], and a floating window is centred
// in what is left. The Elements page was a fixed 9 rows of 70px tiles, which is
// ~800px with its chrome; on a 1080p laptop at 1.25x scale the logical screen
// is 864 tall with 754 usable, so the window sat 17px under the bar and 17px
// under the dock, and at 1.5x (720 logical) it ran off both screen edges.
//
// Pure, so tst_cheatsheet_fit.qml can drive the three measured screens.

// choice, and taking the whole budget shaped the stage like whatever the
// screen minus the panels happened to be. A fraction keeps it a window
// rather than a takeover, and the fixed aspect keeps the stage the same
// shape on every monitor. Width-first: take the share of the width, derive
// the height from the aspect, and if that runs past the height's share,
// bind on the height instead. Either budget missing (0 or less) means the
// window has not learned its screen; the caller keeps its fallback.
