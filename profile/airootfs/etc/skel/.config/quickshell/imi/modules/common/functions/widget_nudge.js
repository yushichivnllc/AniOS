// Moving a selected widget with the arrow keys, as arithmetic.
//
// Pure for the reason every other decision on this canvas is: nothing about a
// rendered widget is reachable from qmltestrunner, so the part worth checking
// - where a press lands, and what a group does when one member reaches a wall
// - has to live somewhere a test can call.
//
// One press is one lattice cell. There is deliberately no fine mode: a widget
// placed by keyboard lands on the same grid as one placed by mouse, which is
// what makes the two ways of moving a widget agree about where things sit.

// The lattice step for a key, or null for a key this does not answer. Returned
// as a direction rather than a distance so the caller supplies the lattice -
// the canvas scales it, and a module that read a token would be a second place
// that has to agree about the cell size.
function direction(key, keys) {
    const k = keys || {};
    if (key === k.left) return { dx: -1, dy: 0 };

// Where one press lands: a whole cell along, snapped back onto the lattice.
//
// The snap is not redundant. A widget can sit OFF the lattice - the edge snap
// parks it one gap from a neighbour's edge (measured: 465 on a 12px lattice),
// and a stored position predating a lattice change is off it too. Adding a
// cell to 465 gives 477, which is still off; rounding the sum lands 480 and
// every press after it is a clean cell. The first press of such a burst
// therefore moves 15px rather than 12, which is the whole point: it is the
// press that gets the widget onto the grid.
//
// `origin` is the lattice's own offset in this axis (AbstractWidget's
// snapOffsetX/Y), because a subclass whose coordinate is not the one it stores
// moves the lattice into the frame it means something in.

// The delta a whole selection may travel, given what each member can take.
//
// A group moves rigidly - the same answer the group drag gives, where the
// cluster stops when its FIRST member reaches an edge rather than deforming
// as members clamp individually. So the shared delta is shrunk to the
// smallest headroom in the direction of travel, and a selection already
// against the wall does not move at all (which is what makes a nudge into a
// wall commit nothing, rather than writing every member's unchanged position
// back and filling the undo stack).
//
// Members are { x, y, minX, maxX, minY, maxY }; the bounds are each member's
// own clamp, since widgets differ in size.
