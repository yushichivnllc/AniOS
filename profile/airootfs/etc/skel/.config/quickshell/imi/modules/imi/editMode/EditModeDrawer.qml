/**
 * Edit Mode's drawer: the catalogue of everything the mode can add, one
 * section per target surface - desktop widgets (`PluginManager.
 * availablePlugins`), bar widgets (`BarWidgets.offerFor`) and dock apps
 * (`DesktopEntries`, through AppSearch's prepared list). Sections rather
 * than three panels because the drawer's width is the viewport's reserved
 * slot and one reservation cannot be three widths.
 *
 * ---- how each section adds --------------------------------------------------
 *
 * The desktop section keeps stage 5's two gestures: click toggles presence,
 * drag carries the widget out to a drop point - the drop lands on the
 * desktop, which is on the surface this drawer draws over, so the geometry
 * works out on this side of the screen.
 *
 * The bar and dock sections add by CLICK only, deliberately. Their drop
 * targets live on OTHER layer surfaces, in other scene graphs, whose slot
 * geometry this surface cannot map (`mapToItem` does not cross windows) -
 * a drag-out whose landing zone is guessed from configuration would disagree
 * with the boundaries the bar draws, which is worse than no drag. Placement
 * is the in-place reorder those surfaces already carry in the mode: a click
 * appends (the bar section to a picked bucket, the dock to the end of the
 * strip), and the new widget arrives badged and draggable where it will be
 * arranged. The bar section's bucket picker names the buckets the way the
 * current orientation draws them.
 *
 * ---- what a row is ----------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * `CatalogueRow` - the icon/name/description/affordance shape this file used to
 * spell out once per row shape, shared with every settings row and the widget
 * store. Counting them here is what went stale the first time a row was added,
 * so the rule is stated instead: EVERY row body in this file is that component,
 * and `test_edit_mode_contract.py` reads them one by one. The rows' INTERACTION
 * is still each section's own, and deliberately: the desktop section's rows are
 * `MouseArea`s (see above), every other row is a `RippleButton`, and the shared
 * component is not interactive at all so it can sit inside either.
 *
 * ---- what this file writes --------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Nothing, same as stage 5: every gesture is a signal, and the chrome surface
 * makes every store write - which is what keeps `lint_edit_mode_scope.py`'s
 * question answerable in one file per store.
