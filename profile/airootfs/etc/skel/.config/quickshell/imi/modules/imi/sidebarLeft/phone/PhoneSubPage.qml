/**
 * The frame every Phone sub-page is rooted on: a title bar with a back
 * affordance and whatever the page puts under it.
 *
 * The page does not own its own lifetime. `Phone.qml` hosts exactly one of
 * these at a time in an overlay Loader keyed on a string id, slides it in,
 * and pops it on `back()` or on Escape - so a page is a plain Item that
 * says what it is called and raises one signal, and nothing about the
 * overlay, the travel or the key handling is spelled a second time per
 * page.
