// Resolving which component-grid span a placed widget occupies.
//
// A manifest's `grid` used to be one constant span (docs/widget-grid.md). It
// may now also carry a `sizes` array - the spans the widget offers - with
// `cols`/`rows` staying as the default. Everything here is pure data so it can
// be driven from a TestCase; the host (PluginWidget) supplies the pixel
// measurements and does the persisting.
//
// The rules that are not obvious:
//   - a `sizes` list the manifest got wrong is rejected whole, never repaired.
//     Dropping the bad entry and keeping the rest would silently offer a
//     different set of spans than the author wrote, and the widget the user
//     already placed would change size on upgrade for reasons nothing reports.
//   - a stored span that the manifest no longer offers falls back to the
//     default rather than being honoured, for the same reason: a widget laid
//     out into a span its content no longer fills looks broken and is not
//     traceable to the manifest edit that caused it.

// `Array.isArray` is not the test, and assuming it was made the whole `sizes`

// through a `Repeater`'s `model` has crossed into QVariant and back: indices
// and `length` survive, `Array.isArray` does not - and `Background.qml` builds
// every desktop widget from exactly such a model, so a manifest declaring
// three spans arrived offering one, with no error anywhere. Measured against a
// real shell, because the synthetic manifests the harness declares inline
// never cross that boundary.
//
// Anything without a numeric `length` is still rejected, which is what keeps a
// malformed `sizes` from being read as an empty list of spans.

// Folding a legacy `sizeMode` option into the host's `__gridSize`.
//
// `sizeMode` was a plugin-*declared* choice option on two bundled widgets, in
// this module's own "<cols>x<rows>" format: a second mechanism for the concept
// `__gridSize` owns, which is why it is retired rather than kept in step.
// Takes a plugin's stored options and its manifest grid; returns the options
// with the old key gone, or null when there is nothing to change.
//
// Deleting the old key rather than merely shadowing it is what makes this
// idempotent - a second pass finds no `sizeMode` and answers null. Four rules
// beyond the obvious mapping, each one a refusal to invent or destroy a size:
//   - **a manifest that does not offer several spans is left alone entirely.**
//     `sizeMode` was not only a retired manifest option: `world-clock` and
//     `calendar` managed one of their own through their own toggles while they
//     declared no `grid`, and migrating on the key name alone would have
//     deleted a live setting and reset both widgets. Both have since adopted
//     `grid.sizes` - the same gate that protected their options is what folds
//     them in - but the gate stays: the next widget in that shape is protected
//     the day it exists.
//   - a stored mode the manifest does not offer is dropped without being
//     written, exactly as resolveSize refuses to honour a stored span that is
//     no longer offered. The widget falls back to its default rather than
//     being laid out into a size its content does not fill.
//   - an existing `__gridSize` wins. It can only have come from the resize
//     grip, which is the more recent choice.
//   - a plugin with no stored options at all is left alone, so the migration
//     never creates state for a widget the user has never placed.
