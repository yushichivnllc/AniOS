// Reordering a list by dragging one of its items, which four surfaces had each
// worked out for themselves: the bar's chip editor (LayoutSection), the dock
// strip (DragApps), the bar's copy of that strip (DocktoPanel) and the Android
// quick toggles (AndroidQuickToggleButton). Two questions between them - which
// slot is the pointer over, and what does the list look like afterwards - and
// four answers that did not agree on the second one.
//
// The disagreement is the reason this exists rather than the duplication.
// LayoutSection and DocktoPanel took the item out and put it back in at the
// drop index, so everything between the two positions shifted along by one;
// DragApps and the quick toggles exchanged the two entries, so a drag across
// three neighbours displaced exactly one of them and left the other two where
// they were. Both are defensible in isolation and only one of them is what a
// drag looks like, so a fifth copy would have been a coin toss - which is the
// shape AGENT.md's CavaService entry describes as two names for one thing
// letting one of them rot.
//
// Nothing here touches a store. A call site still owns where its list lives
// and when it is written back, because those genuinely differ: `Config.options`
// arrays, a `plugin-state.json` blob and a local drag order are three different
// commit paths and only the arithmetic between them is shared.

// The pointer is in scene coordinates and so are the centres; `axis` is "x" or
// "y" to compare along one of them, or null for a 2-D nearest.
//
// One axis is not an optimisation of two - it is the only thing that works in a
// column. Every slot in a vertical dock has the same x, so a 2-D comparison
// there degenerates into comparing a number with itself and the "nearest" slot
// is whichever the loop reached first: not a subtly wrong reorder, an inert one
// (8e608cb61 ("feat(dock): the dock strip lays out along whichever edge it is
// on")). The axis is chosen by the caller because only the caller knows which
// way its slots run.
//
// A hole in `centres` is skipped rather than treated as the origin. Callers
// have two reasons for one: a `Repeater` item that has not been created yet,
// and the dragged slot itself, which must not be its own nearest neighbour.
// Squared distance, because the comparison is all anyone wants and a square
// root is monotonic; ties go to the lower index, matching every loop this
// replaced.

// later, not fling 2 to the far end of the run. Dragging is a continuous
// gesture and a swap makes it discontinuous in the list.

// Which bucket a drop lands in, and where in it - for the bar's three layouts,

// `buckets` is an array of `{ centres, anchor }`: `centres` are the drawn
// slots' scene centres with the same holes `indexAt` takes (the dragged slot,
// a Repeater item not built yet), and `anchor` is a stand-in point for a
// bucket with nothing visible in it - an empty middleLayout has no slot
// centres at all, and without a stand-in it could never win a drop, which is
// exactly the "empty bucket must be a valid drop target" half of the bar's
// bucket boundaries. A bucket whose every slot is a hole is empty in the same
// sense: dragging the only widget of a bucket must leave that bucket
// droppable-back-into.

// The answer's `index` is an INSERTION index (0..length), not a nearest slot:
// the caller splices with it, and "past the last slot" has to be representable

// one axis the buckets run - the same reasoning as `indexAt`'s column note -
