/**
 * The Phone tab's bottom card stack: the scrcpy mirror, the phone webcam, the
 * phone microphone, and one pairing card per peer that has asked to pair.
 *
 * This is the ONE place a card's click becomes a service call, which is what
 * makes "a button whose call no service answers is a fake action" checkable:
 * tests/test_phone_tab_surface_contract.py resolves every `PhoneX.member` in
 * this directory against what the services declare. Two of the sibling fork's
 * chips are deliberately absent for that reason - it offers "phone
 * screenshot", "toggle phone power" and "hear yourself", and PhoneScrcpy and
 * PhoneMic answer none of the three.
 *
 * The stack is one Item the tab places last in its column. It reads nothing
 * from the tab and announces what it cannot do itself: `openPage(id)` with
 * "webcam" or "mic".
 *
 * `showPeripheralCards` hides the three FEATURE cards only. A pairing request
 * is a question a peer asked, not a peripheral, and dropping it because the
 * cards are off would leave no way to answer it.
