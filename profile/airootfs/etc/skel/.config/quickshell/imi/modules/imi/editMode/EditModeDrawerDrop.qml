/**
 * The other half of the drawer's drag: a desktop widget carried back INTO the
 * drawer and let go there leaves the desktop.
 *
 * ---- why the write is here and not on the widget ---------------------------
 *
 * The gesture is split across two layer surfaces and each half is where it can
 * be. The pointer, the widget and its identity are on `quickshell:background`,
 * so that is where the decision is made (`PluginWidget.releaseRemovesWidget`);
 * every store the mode writes is written under `modules/imi/editMode/`, which
 * is the directory `lint_edit_mode_scope.py` polices - a `plugins.enabled`
 * write moved one directory sideways is that lint's own worked example of how
 * the rule gets lost. So the drop is announced through `GlobalStates` and
 * answered here.
 *
 * It is not a method on `EditModeChromeSurface` for the reason
 * `EditWidgetMenuContent` gives for owning its own Remove: this write is
 * id-keyed with no geometry in it, and the surface is a `PanelWindow` no
 * harness can construct (weston implements no wlr-layer-shell), so putting it
 * there would put it where no test reaches it.
 *
 * ---- and why there is exactly one --------------------------------------------
 *
 * `plugins.enabled` is ONE global list drawn on every monitor - the reason the
 * menu's Remove removes everywhere - so a listener per chrome surface would
 * answer one drop once per screen and spend an undo entry on each. This is
 * declared once, beside the menu's window, in `EditModeChrome.qml`.
