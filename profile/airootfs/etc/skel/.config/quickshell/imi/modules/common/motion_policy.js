// interaction_motion.js does: the DECISIONS are testable and the rendering is
// not. Whether a slider at 0.4 can reach the reduce-motion state, whether a
// twentieth item in a cascade waits forever, and whether a hidden row still
// costs its neighbours a slot are all answerable without a compositor.

// The surveyed fork spells the same idea as `animationMultiplier <= 0.25`,
// re-derived by hand as a private `_animationsDisabled` at seven call sites -
// so "the user turned motion off" and "the user likes it snappy" are one
// number there, and every reader has to agree on where the line is.

// to when the user asks for reduced motion. Named and declared once, because
// the alternative is a magic minimum inside a helper that no test can name and
// no reader can find.
//
// It is a DURATION rather than "switch the Behaviors off", and it is zero
// rather than a small positive number. Both halves were measured with a qml6
// probe rather than reasoned about:
//
//   - A `NumberAnimation` driven by a `Behavior` never emits `finished` at ANY
//     duration - it is run as an animation job rather than through `start()` -
//     while an animation the code STARTS emits `finished` even at duration 0.
//     Every cleanup in this shell that hangs off a completion (the bar popup
//     overlay releasing its outgoing content tree, ExpandablePanel destroying
//     a spent stagger animation) hangs off a started one, so a floor of 0
//     strands none of them. A floor implemented as "disable the Behavior"
//     would have reached only half of that and left the started animations
//     running at full length.
//   - Collapsing the DURATIONS also reaches the two places a Behavior does
//     not: a `Timer` whose interval is a tier duration, and a
//     `PauseAnimation` written as the difference of two tiers. Both go to
//     zero together, so a sequence built out of them keeps its order.

// docs/p3drovfx-motion-measured-2026-08-22.md §3 as opacity 0->1, scale from
// 0.85 and +25px->0). The rendering is `StaggerEntrance.qml`; the one decision
// in it is here, because it is the one a test can hold still: where the scale
// STARTS.
//
// The scale is derived from the rise and the width it plays on, never picked.
// The survey's 0.85 is a popup's compact cards; on a full-width row the same
// factor is a horizontal swing wider than the rise it accompanies - a zoom,
// not a settle. Matching the scale's excursion to the rise keeps the two
// terms one motion at any width, and the measured 0.85 stays as the floor so

// the one technique in that survey that is theirs rather than M3's: M3 says a
// group enters in sequence and says nothing about what the group's own
// container is doing while it happens.

// they do not leave at all - they stay drawn and ride the container off, which
// is what makes an exit one rigid transform rather than a second, contradictory
// cascade. So the closing branch holds until the container has nothing left,
// and whatever reset the next entrance needs happens there, off screen.
//
// `opening` is the caller's own intent flag, never a direction inferred from
// the progress. An intent flips at the click and the progress follows, so the
// two branches are entered by different events and there is no ordering to get
// wrong; inferring the direction would need a previous value, which is state,
// which is the thing this module deliberately does not have.
// No isFinite guard, deliberately: every comparison against NaN is false, so an
// absent or unparseable progress already answers "not arrived" on both
// branches. A guard here would be a line no test could redden - the shape
