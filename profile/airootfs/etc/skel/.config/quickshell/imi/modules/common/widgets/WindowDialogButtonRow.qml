/**
 * The action row at the foot of a `WindowDialog`, in the dialog's own content
 * box like every other row in it.
 *
 * It used to carry `Layout.margins: -Appearance.spacing.space100` to buy back
 * 8px of the card's padding. That is not free space: the row was the only child
 * of the content column that left it, so the confirming button's edge stopped
 * lining up with whatever sat above it and the card's bottom padding came out
 * 8px short of its top. Measured on the polkit prompt, the one dialog with a
 * full-width field directly over the actions - the card's four paddings read
 * 23/23/23/15 and the OK button's right edge sat 8px past the field's.
