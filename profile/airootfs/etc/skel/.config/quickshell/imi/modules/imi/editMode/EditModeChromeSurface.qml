/**
 * One screen's worth of Edit Mode's chrome: a full-screen layer surface that is
 * transparent everywhere except the toolbar and the tab bar on it.
 *
 * ---- why it is not on the background surface -------------------------------
 *
 * The desktop stays where it is (spec §2.3): it is where the wallpaper and the
 * `WidgetCanvas` already are, and moving it would cost the live-wallpaper frost
 * a `ShaderEffectSource` can only reach in its own scene graph. But that surface
 * is `quickshell:background` on `WlrLayer.Bottom`, and the bar and the dock stay
 * in place at full size, above it - measured on the live session, the three
 * layers come out as background / dock+bar / screenCorners+barPopup. Chrome
 * drawn on the background would be under the bar. So the chrome takes a surface
 * of its own on `Overlay`, and the viewport does not move.
 *
 * ---- the three things a surface this size has to get right ------------------
 *
 * **Input.** A screen-sized surface that accepts input everywhere makes the
 * desktop underneath unclickable - and the desktop underneath is the thing being
 * edited. The mask is the two chrome rects and nothing else, so every other
 * pixel falls through to the widgets. The surface also does not exist at all
 * while the mode is off (`EditModeChrome.qml`'s loader), which is the state
 * nobody looks at and therefore the dangerous one.
 *
 * **Blur.** `rules.lua`'s catch-all is `blur = true` with `ignore_alpha = 0.05`
 * for every `quickshell:*` namespace, under which a screen-sized surface of
 * transparent pixels asks the compositor to blur the entire screen. So the
 * namespace is minted AND listed there, at `ignore_alpha = 1`: the two toolbar
 * bodies are opaque (`m3surfaceContainer`), so they are the only thing blurred
 * and their shadows and the whole transparent remainder are left alone. That is
 * the same treatment `quickshell:recordingRegion` and `quickshell:overlay`
 * carry, for the same shape of surface. Reusing `quickshell:popup` was the other
 * temptation and `BarPopupOverlay.qml:53-69` records why not - its
 * `ignore_alpha = 1` is inherited by every xdg-popup opened from the surface,
 * which is how the tray menus stopped being blurred.
 *
 * **Keyboard.** `None` by default, deliberately: Escape is answered by
 * `WidgetCanvas` on the background surface, through `edit_mode.js`'s ladder,
 * and a chrome surface holding `OnDemand` focus would sit in front of it and
 * swallow the key. The one exception is the drawer's app search field, which
 * cannot be typed into at `None` at all - the surface follows its focus, so
 * it is `OnDemand` for exactly as long as the field is being typed into, and
 * the field's own first Escape hands the keyboard straight back.
