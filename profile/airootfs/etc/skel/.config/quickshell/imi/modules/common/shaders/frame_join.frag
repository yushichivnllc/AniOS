#version 440

// The split's neck as a distance field (docs/proposals/motion-split.md §1,
// §6): the pill's rounded box and the band's half-plane, joined by a
// polynomial smooth-minimum whose radius is the neck - the bridge, its two
// concave flanks and the corners rounding are all the one blend, covered
// once, so nothing is antialiased against anything else (a drawn path under
// the pill composited to a hairline). The blend radius falls off along the
// band from the waist's centre, so the neck narrows in width to nothing at
// the pinch rather than letting go all at once - a flat edge over a flat band
// is the same distance everywhere, which a uniform blend bridges whole or not
// at all.
