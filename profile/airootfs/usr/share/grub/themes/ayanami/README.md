# Ayanami, 1080p

Fixed 1920×1080 GRUB canvas, centered with padding on larger modes.

Install through the repository's `install.sh` or `sudo eva` chooser. The loader selects the graphics mode and loads the packaged PF2 fonts.

Runtime files are `theme.txt`, `background.png`, `fonts/`, `selectors/` and `progress/`. The `icons/` directory supplies entry-number badges. `runtime-ready.json` records the files checked by the installer.

Entries and the countdown come from the existing GRUB configuration. 4 rows are visible; larger menus scroll.

Selecting an entry switches to full-screen console output with live boot messages. See [boot behaviour](../../../docs/BOOT_CONSOLE.md).

See [installation](../../../docs/ADVANCED.md) and [artwork and font notices](../../../docs/NOTICE.md).
