 * A card whose content animates into and out of the layout, implementing the

 * re-derive it.
 *
 * `expanded` is driven by the call site, never by this component: existing
 * surfaces trigger from a ConfigSwitch, a chevron button and nav-rail state,
 * so a built-in trigger would fit none of them.
 *
 * Plugin-facing. The property names here are a compatibility surface for
 * third-party plugins - see docs/PLUGINS.md before renaming any of them.
