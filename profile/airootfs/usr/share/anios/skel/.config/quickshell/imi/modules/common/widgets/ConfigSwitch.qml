    // same right edge the switch sits on; inside the label block they would
    // stop short of the switch and hang diagonally beneath it.

    // no height, so this costs nothing elsewhere.

    // Sits on the label's own line, immediately after it. For a secondary
    // phrase that belongs to the title rather than under it - a byline, a
    // version. The label is one StyledText, so a caller cannot mix type sizes
    // into it directly.
    property alias titleContent: catalogueRow.titleContent

    // switch is the last thing in this component, so anything a call site
    // appends to its own row can only land beyond it.
    property alias trailingContent: catalogueRow.trailingContent
    // A click is an intent to flip, not a state change of its own. Assigning to
    // `checked` from a handler destroys the call site's `checked:` binding on
    // the very first click, after which nothing external - a preset, a
    // hand-edited config, a migration - can move the switch again, while the
    // row's own write-back keeps working: the setting changes and the switch
    // lies (#158). The call site owns the value and flips it at the source;
    // `checked` here only ever follows it back.
    //
    // A signal of its own rather than AbstractButton's inherited `toggled()`:
    // RippleButton declares `property bool toggled` (its "draw me as active"

    // the property's change handler rather than this.

    // Nothing in here dims itself on `enabled`. RippleButton already applies the
    // disabled opacity to this whole control - including the switch track, which
    // has none of its own - so a second binding on the icon, the label or a
    // content slot multiplies rather than replaces it, and the row landed at
    // 0.4 * 0.4 = 0.16 instead of 0.4. tests/lint_disabled_opacity.py holds the
