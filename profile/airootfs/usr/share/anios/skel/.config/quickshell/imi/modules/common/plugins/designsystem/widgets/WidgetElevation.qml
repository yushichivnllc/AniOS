// The one shadow a desktop widget casts.
//
// `WidgetCard` owned this along with the card surface, which served the four
// widgets that are cards. Five older bundled widgets are not cards and never
// could be - a cookie dial, a punched glyph grid, a shape-masked image, and a
// card with an avatar bubble straddling its top edge - and each carried its
// own `StyledDropShadow` at its own radius, colour and alpha. So the elevation
// is the piece that moves out: wrap whatever a widget actually paints and it
// casts the tuned shadow (`Appearance.elevation`, picked on the real wallpaper
// in ShadowTuningPlayground), lifts on hover and further on drag, and drops
// the shadow while it is moving.
//
// The shadow follows PAINTED ALPHA, which is the point: a rounded card, a
// twelve-lobed cookie and a Heart-masked photograph all cast the shape they
// actually draw. It follows from that where this belongs in a widget - around
// the BODY, never around a whole widget whose labels and glyphs would each
// cast one too.
//
// The frame carrying the layer is inset NEGATIVELY, because a layer clips at
// its item's bounds and both the shadow and the card's elastic resize bow are
// drawn outside them. Children still see this item's own box: the bleed is
// added on the frame and taken straight back off the body, so no call site
// compensates for it.
