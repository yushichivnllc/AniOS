/**
 * The runner for a panel fastened to a screen edge: it slides in from that
 * edge and back out, and the SURFACE it lives on stays mapped the whole time.
 *
 * That second half is the reason this exists. A layer surface cannot be
 * reused, so a PanelWindow whose `visible` follows the flag that asks for it
 * is destroyed on close and rebuilt on open - a new render thread, a new GL
 * context, the whole scene graph built from nothing and every glyph uploaded
 * again. The shell has ONE GUI thread for all of its windows, and measured
 * with QSG_RENDER_TIMING on the real session that thread sat blocked for
 * 61ms per open (`blockedForSync=61 ms, polish=0`) - every other window the
 * shell draws frozen for fifteen frames at 240Hz, the "momentary freeze right
 * before they open". The same open with the window kept mapped: 1-3ms.
 *
 * So the slide is QML's rather than the compositor's. The layerrule that
 * used to animate the map (`animation = slide right`) is `no_anim` now, and
 * the tiers here are pinned to what that rule drew: Hyprland's `layersIn` /
 * `layersOut` at speed 4 on `pc_decel` / `pc_accel`. The look did not change;
 * who draws it did.
 *
 * Three things the adopter has to do, because a persistent surface is a
 * surface that can eat input and focus while showing nothing:
 *
 *  - gate the window's `mask` on the gesture's flag, so a closed panel is a
 *    hole the pointer falls through;
 *  - gate `WlrLayershell.keyboardFocus` on it, because an always-mapped
 *    surface with OnDemand focus is a surface that takes the keyboard;
 *  - hide the content on `shown`, not on the flag - `shown` stays true for
 *    the length of the exit, which is the one reason the exit can be seen.
 *
 * A QtObject rather than an Item, for StaggerWave's reason: declared inside
 * the window it drives, an Item would become a member of it. The animations
 * are declared properties because a QtObject has no `data`.
