/**
 * Frame mode's geometry authority (docs/proposals/frame-mode.md): the shell's
 * edge surfaces read where the frame is from here instead of each deciding
 * for itself. Stage 1: one frame for every screen, the bar's edge is the
 * bar, the other three edges are a band as thick as the compositor's outer
 * gap (or `appearance.frame.thickness`), and the four inner corners carry
 * the screen-rounding fillet in the frame's colour. The dock is not part of
 * the frame: a pinned dock meets the band on its own edge - sitting on it as
 * a tab (`appearance.frame.dock` "attached") or a gap above it ("floating")
 * - and reads `dockAttachedFor(pinned)` and `thickness` from here to do so
 * (modules/imi/dock/DockReservation.qml). Off by default; a vertical bar is
 * not framed yet.
