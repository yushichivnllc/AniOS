/**
 * One entry in a catalogue, drawn: a leading icon, a name, a description under
 * it, and whatever affordance says what happens if you act on the entry.
 *
 * Four surfaces had spelled that out by hand - Edit Mode's drawer five times
 * over (desktop widgets, bar widgets, dock apps, the lock islands, the lock
 * layout row), `ConfigSwitch` for every settings row in the shell, and the
 * plugin store's cards - and they had already drifted: the same plugin's
 * description elided in one, wrapped in another and was absent from the third,
 * and the byline sat on the title's line in one place and under it in another.
 *
 * ---- this component is not interactive, deliberately --------------------
 *
 * It has no `MouseArea`, no `Button` root and no hover state, because the
 * three surfaces cannot agree on one and must not be forced to. Edit Mode's
 * drawer rows are pointer areas BY CONSTRUCTION (65602708e): dragging a widget
 * out of the clipped drawer needs the implicit grab of the press to keep
 * delivering events after the pointer has left the row, which a control that
 * hands its press to a `Button` does not preserve - and `test_edit_mode_
 * contract.py` names the drawer as the deliberate exception to its
 * no-`MouseArea` sweep for exactly that reason. Everything else here is a
 * `RippleButton`. So the interactive surface stays with the call site and this
 * draws inside it.
 *
 * ---- what decides the row's height --------------------------------------
 *
 * Its labels and its affordance, never its leading glyph: the icon sits in a
 * wrapper that reports width only, so a decorative 23px glyph cannot stretch a
 * list of rows whose text is 15px. That is `OptionalMaterialSymbol`'s own
 * shape, kept rather than repaired, because every settings row in the shell is
 * already sized that way.
