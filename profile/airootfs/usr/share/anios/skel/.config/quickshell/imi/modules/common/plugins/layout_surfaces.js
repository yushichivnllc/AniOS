.pragma library

// Two widget layouts, one store: the desktop's and the lock screen's, and the
// rule by which the second inherits the first until it is edited. Position,
// span and PRESENCE all fork under that one rule - see the presence section
// near the bottom for why the third joined them and why it is not per screen.
//
// Spec §4.3 chose ONE stored position per widget, shared by both surfaces, and
// gave two reasons - a second position doubles the placement model, and
// presets capture positions wholesale. The maintainer overruled it on
// 2026-08-18: "lockscreen widget layout is meant to be different from desktop
// layout if the user decides to alter the widgets and their order in
// lockscreen." The `if` is load-bearing and is what this module encodes.
//
// FORK ON FIRST EDIT. `lockPositions` sits beside `desktopPositions` with the
// same [screen][pluginId] shape, and a screen ABSENT from it means "the lock
// shows the desktop's layout" - the spec's model is still the state every
// user is in until they move something on the Lockscreen tab. The first lock
// write for a screen copies that screen's whole desktop layout across before
// applying the move, so the fork is a snapshot: after it, every widget on that
// screen follows the lock store, none half-follows the desktop. Deleting the
// screen's entry re-links it.
//
// Pure, .pragma library, no QML: the decisions here are the ones that would
// otherwise be reachable only through a running PluginState with a file behind
// it, and tst_layout_surfaces.qml drives every branch bare. PluginState is the
// caller that turns "the lock look is on" into a surface name and writes the
// result to disk.

// ---- presence, forked the same way -----------------------------------------
//
// WHICH widgets the lock screen shows was one all-or-nothing boolean
// (`lock.showWidgets`, "show every desktop widget while locked") while WHERE
// they sit had already forked. So a widget could not be on the desktop and not
// on the lock, and the model the maintainer chose for the layout was not the
// model the presence beside it used.
//
// `lockPresence` is that fork, in the same shape and under the same rule:
// ABSENT (null) means "the lock shows whatever the desktop shows", and the
// first pick on the Lockscreen tab snapshots the desktop's enabled set into a
// map of its own. From then on the two are independent in both directions - a
// widget can be dropped from the lock while it stays on the desktop, and one
// the desktop does not show can be picked for the lock alone.
//
// It is NOT per screen, while the layout is: `plugins.enabled` is one global
// list rendered on every monitor (which is why Edit Mode's Remove row removes
// everywhere), and a per-screen presence store would invent a capability the
// desktop itself does not have. The desktop's own set lives in Config, which
// this module cannot see, so it arrives as an argument - the caller passes
// `Config.options.plugins.enabled`.
//
// `lock.showWidgets` stays above all of it as the master gate: this map says
// which widgets the lock screen shows, that boolean says whether it shows any.
// Which is what keeps an upgrade silent - a user who has it off sees nothing
// on the lock today and nothing after, and a user who has it on is in the
// following state and sees the same set they see now.

// A stored map, not a list and not a sequence that crossed a QML boundary.
// `Array.isArray` is false for the latter (109e6d897), so the length is what
// distinguishes them - an empty map is a legitimate forked state ("the lock
// shows nothing"), which is exactly why absence has to be spelled `null`.

// purpose - a user who rotates the monitor for the lock still wants its blur
// to follow the desktop, and "which keys I changed for the lock" is the model
// the Settings switch shows and its Reset undoes. Writing null removes the
