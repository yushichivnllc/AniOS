/**
 * The frame: ONE surface per screen, drawing the four bands in the bar's
 * colour so bar, bands and the ScreenCorners bezel read as one connected
 * surface (docs/proposals/frame-one-surface.md, stage 1). The band on the
 * bar's edge sits under the bar plate; every other edge, the dock's included,
 * is the band alone - a pinned dock meets it on its own terms (Dock.qml: on it
 * as a tab, or a gap above it).
 *
 * One surface rather than four, and the reason is what a surface IS to the
 * compositor: the unit blur is computed against, and the outline a specular
 * edge will one day be drawn along. Four band surfaces were four outlines
 * meeting at four corners, each corner an overlap two translucent surfaces
 * could paint twice - which is why `bandMargins` keeps them from crossing.
 * On one surface the bands are items, the crossing arithmetic still holds
 * (an overlapping pair of translucent Rectangles double-paints too), and
 * there is one blur region for the whole border rather than four that have
 * to agree.
 *
 * What a screen-sized, always-mapped surface has to get right, each of which
 * this tree has paid for once (AGENT.md, layer-shell gotchas): its geometry
 * is a constant of the screen - four edges anchored, no margins - so nothing
 * ever reconfigures it; it takes no input (an empty mask) and no keyboard;
 * and it stays on `quickshell:frame`, whose rules.lua entry carries `no_anim`
 * and `blur = false` - a minted namespace would fall through the catch-all
 * `ignore_alpha = 0.05`, under which a screen of transparent pixels asks the
 * compositor to blur the entire output. Nothing is reserved: the bands live
 * in the outer gap windows already leave. Painted transparent, never
 * unmapped, for a fullscreen window - `visible` on a layer surface destroys
 * it.
