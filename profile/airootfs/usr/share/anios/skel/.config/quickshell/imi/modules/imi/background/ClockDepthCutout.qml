/**
 * The wallpaper's subject, cut out of the wallpaper by its mask.
 *
 * One component because there are two call sites that must never be able to
 * disagree: Background.qml draws this over the desktop widgets, and the
 * wallpaper selector's picker draws it to ask the user whether the cutout is
 * any good. Those were two hand-written copies of the same stack - the same
 * `coverRect` call, the same clipping mask surface, the same OpacityMask -
 * which is a visualizer that can drift from the thing it exists to judge, and
 * a visualizer that disagrees with the layer is worse than none: it certifies
 * a mask against a registration the desktop never uses.
 *
 * Everything geometric about the registration is here and nowhere else;
 * `tests/lint_clock_depth_geometry.py` fails the suite on a second caller of
 * `coverRect`.
