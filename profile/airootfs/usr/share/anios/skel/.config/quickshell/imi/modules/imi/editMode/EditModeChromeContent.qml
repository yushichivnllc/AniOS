/**
 * Edit Mode's chrome: the one toolbar above the shrunk desktop, with the
 * mode's tabs leading it.
 *
 * Split out of the surface that hosts it for the reason `EditModeCard` is split
 * out of `Background.qml` - weston implements no wlr-layer-shell, so the only
 * way anything here is ever looked at by a test is as a plain `Item` a probe
 * can put in a window of its own.
 *
 * ---- where it sits --------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Everything is placed off `card`, the rectangle the desktop is drawn at, which
 * is `edit_mode.js`'s `cardRect` - the same arithmetic the desktop's own
 * transform is built out of. So the chrome cannot be a pixel off the thing it
 * frames, and it does not need a second copy of the geometry to be wrong about.
 *
 * That also gives the motion for free, and gives it the RIGHT shape: `card` is
 * a function of `GlobalStates.editProgress`, so the toolbar rises out of the
 * top edge exactly as fast as the desktop shrinks away from it. At progress 0
 * the band has zero height and the toolbar is parked half off screen, which is
 * why nothing here needs a `Behavior` of its own - and must not have one: a
 * Behavior whose target moves every frame restarts every frame and never ticks
 * (b710ef731 ("fix(plugins): stop the position Behavior swallowing the
 * parallax cancellation")).
 *
 * The tab bar used to be a second toolbar in a mirror band under the desktop.
 * It moved up here on the maintainer's ask - the tabs lead the toolbar, undo
 * and redo sit before Done - and the desktop took the band it left.
 *
 * ---- what it is made of ---------------------------------------------------
 *
 * `Toolbar` with a `ToolbarTabBar` inside it, which is the shell's M3
 * expressive toolbar and its toolbar tab bar - the same pieces the cheatsheet,
 * the region selector, the recording controls and the lock islands are built
 * from. A bespoke card matching the desktop's own outline and 30px corner was
 * the other option and would have been a second toolbar look minted for one
 * mode, which is the drift this repo keeps paying for. What ties it to the
 * card is the shadow both carry, not a copied radius.
