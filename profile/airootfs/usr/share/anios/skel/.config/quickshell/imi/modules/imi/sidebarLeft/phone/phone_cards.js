// Everything the Phone tab's feature cards, its install guide and its Android
// Apps page DECIDE, kept here because nothing about the drawn cards is
// reachable from qmltestrunner - it can build neither a RippleButton nor a
// laid-out box (the reasoning tst_marquee.qml and tst_placeholder_fit.qml
// already record). tests/tst_phone_cards.qml drives all of it.
//
// Strings are not decided here. A key comes back and the call site maps it to
// a Translation.tr("...") literal: the translation extractor only sees that
// literal form, and a .pragma library has no engine context to reach
// Translation from anyway. tests/test_phone_tab_surface_contract.py fails if a
// key this module can return has no arm at the call site - an unmapped key is
// a card that draws an empty line.

// service that publishes a `state`, and two cards deriving it one way and the
// third another is how three cards come to disagree about what "offline"

// The mirror's own state. A launch error is drawn as `offline` (the sibling
// fork's choice): the card is not running, and the subtitle carries the
// error's first line, so a second state would say the same thing twice.
//
// `launching` is the whole window between the click and the supervisor
// answering, and it is a rung of its own so that it cannot be mistaken for
// `running`: PhoneScrcpy holds it from launchMirror() until either the
// session has survived its settle or the supervisor reports an exit. The
// service used to leave it the moment the supervisor said it had SPAWNED
// scrcpy, which is not the same event.
//
// The same is true of a phone that is reachable over KDE Connect but that
// `adb devices` does not list: scrcpy has nothing to attach to, so the card
// cannot start - and that is knowable BEFORE the click, the way missing
// tooling already is. It is `offline` for the same reason a launch error is,
// and the subtitle says which of the two links is the missing one.
//
// `adbDevice` is deliberately TRI-STATE. `undefined` means the probe has not
// answered yet, which must not read as a refusal - PhoneDeps' flags all start
// false, so a plain falsy test would put every card on "no device" for the
// first frames of every session, and would silently refuse for ever at any
