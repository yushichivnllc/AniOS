/**
 * The frame join's FIELD: the plate, the neck between it and the band, and
 * the band's own surface, as one distance field drawn by one ShaderEffect
 * (shaders/frame_join.frag). FrameJoin owns the physics; this is the painter,
 * split out so the field can be drawn on a surface other than the one whose
 * element is moving - docs/proposals/frame-one-surface.md, stage 2: the frame
 * surface draws the dock's plate, so the whole silhouette is ONE outline on
 * one surface, which is what a blur region and later a specular rim can be
 * made to follow.
 *
 * Everything arrives in the PARENT's coordinates: the plate's rect, the
 * band's inner edge along the edge's axis, and the solver's numbers. It reads
 * no service and no singleton - a caller on the dock's surface hands it the
 * plate's own geometry, a caller on the frame's hands it a published record,
 * and the cheatsheet's bench hands it a rectangle it drew.
