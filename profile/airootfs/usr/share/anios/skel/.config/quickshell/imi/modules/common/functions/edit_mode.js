// desktop at 92%, which spends the whole mode signal on a border. The shrink IS
// the signal (spec §1.1: there is no scrim), so it has to be legible at every

//
// A ceiling rather than a second inset, because a ceiling cannot break the
// derivation stage 5 plugs into: the space reserved on the right of the desktop
// is `screenWidth - margin - width`, which the drawer term already holds at or

// exists to stop.
//
// Insets rather than a rectangle as the input because that is the shape the two
// panels answer in: each occupies one EDGE, across its own axis, and nothing
// about either is a rectangle in the middle of the screen. `EditModeInsets` is

// The SIZE is derived, not chosen: the desktop shrinks by at least what the
// drawer will need, so the drawer opens into space that already exists rather
// than covering the desktop or resizing it (spec §1.2, §1.3) - and by at least
// what the CHROME will need above and below it, so the toolbar and the tab bar
// have somewhere to be rather than wherever the ceiling happens to leave them.
//
// That second term is the one that was missing. The band the shrink opened was
// whatever fell out of `MAX_SCALE` - 100.8px at 5120x1440 - and the toolbar is
// 56px centred in it, which starts 22.4px down a screen whose bar occupies the
// first 68. Reserving the chrome's own thickness plus a margin either side of
// it, inside the usable area, is what makes the clearance a property of the
// arithmetic instead of a literal tuned against `Appearance.sizes.barHeight`.
//
// The POSITION is dead centre OF THE USABLE AREA, and the two are deliberately
// separate. Centre of the usable area rather than of the panel, because the
// desktop has to sit in the space the chrome frames and the chrome has to clear
// the bar and the dock; on the machine this was measured against the two
// centres are 3.5px apart on a 1440-tall screen, so "dead centre" survives the
// re-reading rather than being traded away by it.
//
// Entering the mode is a concentric shrink - the desktop gets smaller where it
// is, and nothing slides - because reserving the drawer's width inside the
// resting geometry makes the entry asymmetric from its first frame: it drifts
// toward one edge on the way in, which reads as being shoved aside rather than
// lifted off the wallpaper, and it does it whether or not a drawer exists yet.
// The drawer's width is still what decides how far the desktop moves when the
// drawer OPENS; that is a translation applied at that point, in stage 5, on top
// of the `x` this returns.
//
// The arithmetic that lets those two coexist: a centred desktop has
// `(screenWidth - width) / 2` free on each side, and the scale below holds
// `width <= screenWidth - drawerWidth - 2 * margin`, so each side has at least
// `drawerWidth / 2 + margin`. Opening a drawer of `drawerWidth + margin` on the
// right therefore needs the desktop to travel at most `drawerWidth / 2` left,
// which leaves exactly `margin` on its other side. The reservation is real; it
// is just spent when the drawer arrives instead of being held back from the
// start.
//
// `drawerWidth` is passed whether or not the drawer is open, and this function
// has no input for the open state on purpose. A desktop that was full width
// with the drawer closed would be RESIZED by opening it, and a viewport that
// changes size mid-edit rescales every widget under the cursor: a drag in
// flight finds its target a different size than when it was grabbed, and every
// Behavior carrying the box is handed a moving target, which per b710ef731
// ("fix(plugins): stop the position Behavior swallowing the parallax
// cancellation") means it restarts every frame and never ticks.
//
// `margin` is one token: the gap between the desktop and the screen's edge, and
// the gap between the desktop and the drawer's slot once there is a drawer.
//
// `edgeMargin` is the OTHER gap - between the chrome and the usable area's own
// edge - and it is a second token because the two are not the same distance.
// The desktop's margin is a gap between two pieces of content and wants to be
// generous; the chrome's is a gap between a floating toolbar and the edge of
// the screen and wants to be tight, because every pixel of it is taken off the
// desktop the mode exists to show. It defaults to `margin`, which is the
// symmetric band the geometry had before the two were told apart.
//
// `chromeThickness` is the toolbar's own height, and it is passed rather than
// measured for the same reason `drawerWidth` is: the desktop's transform is
// built out of this function on the BACKGROUND surface, where neither the
// toolbar nor the tab bar exists. `Appearance.sizes.toolbarHeight` is the one
// number both this and the toolbars themselves read.

// The stack itself lives in GlobalStates (in memory, session-scoped, gone
// with a restart - §7.4's argument that a restart mid-edit already does the
// right thing); these are its arithmetic, kept pure so the bound, the LIFO
// order and the copy-on-write shape are reachable from tst_edit_mode.qml.
// Entries are opaque here - at the call sites each one is a closure over the
// store write that reverses a committed mutation, never a diff, because a
// diff needs a serialiser per store and there are three stores.

// An entry that inverts itself, which is what gives the stack a redo without
// a second protocol: running it restores `value` through `write` and returns
// the entry that restores what was there the moment before, read through
// `read`. Undo runs the top entry and keeps what it returns on the redo
// stack; redo runs THAT and keeps its return on the undo stack. Every push
// site says how to read and how to write its one store path (the write keeps
// the literal path lint_edit_mode_scope asks for) and hands over the value it
// captured before its own mutation. A self-inverse write - toggling a pin -
// passes a `read` of nothing: whatever it returns is ignored by a write that
// takes no value.
