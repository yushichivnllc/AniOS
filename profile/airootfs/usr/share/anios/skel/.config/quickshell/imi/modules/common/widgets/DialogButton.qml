    // counting as one exactly while it waits for the response it submitted.
    //
    // Named for the question rather than for the appearance, because the row
    // asks every child duck-typed and `ConfigTextArea` already declares a
    // `filled` of its own - one dropped into an action row reported itself as
    // the dialog's confirming action and outlined every button beside it.

    // THE PAIRING RULE: in a dialog whose confirming action is filled, the
    // dismissing action is outlined; a dialog whose actions are all flat stays
    // flat. Two flat buttons say nothing about which one the dialog is asking
    // for, which a1e8a95a4 ("fix(polkit): the confirming action carries a
    // filled primary container") answered from the filled side - and a bare
    // label beside a filled container reads as a link rather than as the other
    // half of a choice, which is 283ada440 ("fix(editmode): the toolbar's
    // title stops reading as a button") from the other direction: the one
    // question a modal has to answer is which of these can I press.
    //
    // Derived from the row rather than hardcoded at the call site, so a dialog
    // that grows a filled confirm gets its dismissing action's edge without
    // anyone remembering to. A DialogButton outside a WindowDialogButtonRow -
    // the Wi-Fi dialog's rescan glyph - reads `undefined` and stays flat.
