# Tonemap an HDR recording to SDR, in place - the delivery half of HDR capture.

# Recording on an HDR display stores real HDR10 (record.sh picks the _hdr
# codec variants), which is correct in HDR-aware players and washed out in
# everything that does not tonemap - VLC's defaults, Discord embeds, browsers,
# editors. gpu-screen-recorder cannot tonemap at capture time, so when the
# user opts in (screenRecord.tonemapSdr) this runs after the save lands,
# invoked by gsr-saved.sh: probe, tonemap to bt709, atomically replace.
#
# Usage: tonemap-sdr.sh <file.mp4>
# Exits 0 without touching the file when: the toggle is off, the file is
# already SDR, or the probe fails. The original is replaced only by a rename
# of a fully-written temporary, so an interrupted run leaves it intact.

# THE SIGNAL PEAK MUST BE MEASURED FROM THE PIXELS. ffmpeg's `tonemap` filter,
# handed PQ input and no override, assumes a FIXED peak of 10x its reference
# white - 2030 nits - and normalises the curve by it. A desktop capture peaks
# around 235 nits (1.16x), so the whole image was squeezed into the bottom
# eighth of the curve. Scored against the compositor's own SDR rendering of the
# same desktop: SDR white left the converter at 136/255, mean error 27.3/255.
# That 10x is not inferred from the file - `peak=10.0` reproduces the default
# output byte for byte, on clips whose declared MaxCLL differs fourfold.
#
# WHICH IS THE PART THAT MISLEADS: gpu-screen-recorder really does stamp the
# MONITOR's EDID luminance into every recording as mastering-display and
# content-light-level metadata (on this 1015-nit panel every file claims MaxCLL
# 1015 whatever is on screen), and that reads exactly like the cause. It is
# not - the CPU `tonemap` filter never looks at it, and two fixtures tagged 250
# and 1015 nits tonemap identically. It matters only to libplacebo, which does
# read mastering metadata, which is why that chain gets src_max below. Do not
# "fix" this by correcting the file's metadata: the CPU path would not notice.
#
# Keyframes only and downscaled first: bounded work (0.3s on a 5s 5120x1440
# clip) and a peak that lands on the content's p99.99 rather than on one stray
# pixel - measured 235 nits where the frame's absolute maximum was 276.
#
# Floored at 1.0. A peak below reference white would ask the tonemapper to
# EXPAND the signal, and a measurement that fails must not fall back to the
# filter's own 10x, which is the bug: assuming "nothing above SDR white" clips
# a genuine highlight at worst, where 10x crushes every frame.
