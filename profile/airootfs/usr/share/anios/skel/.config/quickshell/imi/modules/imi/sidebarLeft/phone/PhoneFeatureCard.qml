/**
 * One card of the Phone tab's bottom stack: the scrcpy mirror, the phone
 * webcam, the phone microphone.
 *
 * It is a state machine with five rungs - `unavailable | offline | connecting
 * | ready | active` - and the ladder itself lives in phone_cards.js, because
 * nothing about a drawn card is reachable from qmltestrunner
 * (tests/tst_phone_cards.qml drives it). This file is what the rungs LOOK
 * like: a flat container, a shaped glyph, a title, a subtitle, and a trailing
 * mark saying whether the card acts, is working, or is running.
 *
 * `active` is the one rung that changes the card's shape: it grows to carry a
 * detail line (how long the session has been up, and what it is bound to), an
 * inline error banner, a Stop button and the feature's own action chips.
 * Everything else is one height, so a stack of three cards does not reflow
 * every time a phone goes in and out of reach.
 *
 * The card never talks to a service. `clicked()`, `stopClicked()` and
 * `filesDropped(urls)` are announcements; PhoneFeatureCards.qml is what turns
 * them into calls, which is what keeps a card from being a place a fake
 * action can hide.
 *
 * `cardState` rather than QML's own `state`: Item.state drives States/
 * Transitions, and a string property shadowing it means a typo elsewhere in
 * the file silently becomes a state name that matches nothing.
