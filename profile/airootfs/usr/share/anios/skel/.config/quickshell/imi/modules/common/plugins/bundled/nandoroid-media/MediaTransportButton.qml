// One transport control, at every span.
//
// This is the element the whole expressive-morphing design exists for: the
// play button at 3x2 and the play button at 2x1 used to be different objects
// in different files that had never coexisted, so a span change destroyed one
// and constructed the other. Here the button is ONE object whose *style*
// follows the span - the tree repositions it (media_geometry.js owns where)
// and this file owns what it looks like when it gets there.
//
// The styles are the three layouts' own, moved rather than redesigned:
// - 3x2 prev/next: the spinning Cookie12Sided cassette reels (issue #60).
// - 3x2 play: the wide primary pill.
// - 2x2 prev/next: the clock's corner badges. 2x2 play: the artwork circle,
//   because tapping the cookie is what toggles playback there.
// - 2x1 prev/next: the small pills. 2x1 play: the cookie whose outline is
//   also the seek ring - two concentric draws of one path.
//
// Each style lives behind a Loader keyed on (role, span): only one exists at
// a time, so the 2x1's ring canvas is not painting at 3x2 and the 2x2's
// artwork holds no image elsewhere. The BUTTON survives a span change; its
// clothing is allowed to swap. (Cross-style shape morphing is step 6's work,
// on the resize's clock - not smuggled in here.)
