// the wallpaper region directly behind this surface and blurs it, so the widget
// reads as frosted glass over the wallpaper.

// sampled at this surface's rect through a ShaderEffectSource.
//
// - Live Wallpaper Engine wallpaper: the in-shell WallpaperEngineSurface
//   (weSurfaceItem). WE is now drawn on the background surface itself, so the
//   old compositor-blur handoff no longer applies - we blur the live frame
//   ourselves.
// - Static image wallpaper: an Image of the wallpaper, cover-fitted exactly as
//   the desktop draws it (see wallpaperImage).
//
// The rect and the item it is handed to must be in the SAME space, and that
// space is the wallpaper's, not the screen's - see surfaceX/surfaceY. The
// caller owns that conversion (ParallaxMath.sampleOrigin); this component only
// promises to sample where it is told, in an item of the size it is given.

    // Asking for the plain file - no sourceClipRect, cache on, and exactly the

    // oversight. Those are the request parameters a QQuickPixmap cache key is
    // built from, so the per-surface clip rect this used to carry gave every
    // surface a key of its own, and `cache: false` stopped even identical
    // requests from being shared: eight widgets meant sixteen full-resolution
    // decodes of one file queued on Qt's single pixmap-reader thread, and the
    // frost came back one widget at a time, ~0.6s apart. Sharing the key means
    // every surface - and Background's own wallpaper Image, which asks for it
    // the same way - waits on one decode, and a surface created after that
    // decode is Ready in the frame it is built. It also stops a drag
    // re-requesting the wallpaper on every pixel of travel: only the sample
    // rect below moves now.
