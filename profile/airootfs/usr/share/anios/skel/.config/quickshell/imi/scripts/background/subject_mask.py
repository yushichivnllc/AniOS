"""Subject masks for the desktop clock's depth mode, and the cache they live in.

Segmentation costs 1.3-4.5s and ~1GB of transient RSS per run, and produces an
unusable mask roughly a third of the time it produces one at all - so this never
runs on the shell's startup path. The shell only ever asks `status`, which reads
directory entries and returns in milliseconds; `run` is reached from an explicit
user action in the wallpaper picker.

This script owns the cache key. The shell must never compute one: two
implementations of a hash in two languages is the `activeStill` shape, two things
that must agree with nothing reporting it when they stop.

The key is the wallpaper's path, mtime and size. Path alone is wrong - this
library is full of files edited and re-exported in place, and a stale mask over a
changed image is the worst failure this feature has. Including mtime and size
makes an in-place edit produce a new key automatically, and the old entry becomes
garbage the sweep collects.

Four files can exist per key, and they are the four states of section 5 of
docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-16-clock-depth-design.md:

    <key>.<model>.png   a candidate mask a model produced (see `write_mask` for its size)
    <key>.<model>.none  that model looked and found no subject
    <key>.png           the candidate the user accepted - the ONLY file the shell draws
    <key>.off           the user declined every candidate for this wallpaper

A fifth file exists for the prompted model only, and it is not a state:

    <key>.<model>.embedding.npz   the wallpaper encoded once, so clicks are cheap

Two kinds of model live behind those four states. The salient detectors
(isnet-*) answer on their own and are asked with `run`. The prompted one
(mobile-sam) answers a click and is asked with `select` - because on the bulk of
this library the salient models have no answer at all: swept over the 91
wallpapers here, one was accepted, 43 produced a candidate, and 45 returned
nothing from BOTH models. Measured before any threshold, isnet-general-use
claims 2.78% of `aishot-3263.jpg` at 0.1 confidence and isnet-anime 0.07%, so
there is no threshold that recovers those pictures - the models are salient
object detectors and a full-bleed wallpaper has no background to separate a
subject from. Pointing at the subject is the answer, not a lower bar.

Output is JSON on stdout rather than a bare path because the shell has to tell
those states apart, and a path can only carry "yes" and "no".

    and nearly a second of write time) and no longer the model's 1024 square
    either, because the hardened edge is finer than 1024 texels can carry
    over a wide picture (see MASK_STORE_SIDE). This function does no resample
    of its own, so a test can hand it an 8x8 plane and read the 8x8 back.

    Grayscale AND alpha, both the same plane. The alpha is what the shell masks
    with - Qt's OpacityMask reads the mask's alpha channel and nothing else, so a
    plain "L" PNG is opaque everywhere and lets the whole wallpaper through,
    which paints the picture flat over the clock instead of the subject behind
    it. The luminance is kept beside it so the file is still a mask to look at,

    A function of its own rather than four lines inside `run`, because it is the
    only part of the produced artifact that is testable without a model.

    A prompted mask carries the clicks that produced it in a PNG text chunk,
    INSIDE the file. Three alternatives were available and each of them is a
    pair that has to agree:

    - putting the prompt in the cache key mints an entry per click, so a
      five-click refinement leaves five masks and the question "which of these
      did the user accept" needs a sixth file to answer it;
    - a sidecar JSON beside the mask is two files a sweep, a copy or a crash can
      separate - and `accept` is a byte copy, so the sidecar would have to be
      copied too, by hand, in the one place forgetting is silent;
    - recording it in the config is a per-wallpaper map keyed by a runtime path,
      which is exactly what `Config.qml`'s JsonAdapter cannot hold.

    In the file, the prompt cannot arrive without its mask or outlive it, the
    byte-for-byte `accept` carries it for free, and `accepted_model`'s
    content comparison still works because both sides carry the same chunk.
