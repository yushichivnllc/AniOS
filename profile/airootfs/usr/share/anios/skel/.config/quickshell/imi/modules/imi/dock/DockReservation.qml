/**
 * What a pinned dock asks of the compositor on its edge, from the dock's own
 * derivation (dock_geometry.js): the zone it reserves - the ONE value
 * Dock.qml's exclusiveZone reads - and, in frame mode, how far the whole
 * surface moves in from the screen edge to meet the frame's band
 * (services/FrameGeometry.qml). The surface sits where the ATTACHED tab
 * needs it in both states; floating is the pill lifting inside it
 * (docs/proposals/motion-split.md §6), so the switch is drawn rather than
 * reconfigured. What still steps is the zone - Dock.qml adds the lift while
 * the pill is up or asked to go up (`splitZoneExtra`), per screen, since the
 * pin and the fullscreen state are the screen's. The compositor adds the
 * margin to the zone by itself. It lives here, on the dock's side, rather
 * than as an Appearance token: the design-token singleton is the layer
 * everything builds on and should know no feature.
