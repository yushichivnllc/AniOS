/**
 * Edit Mode's desktop, drawn as a card lifted off its own wallpaper.
 *
 * The mode shrinks the desktop with a transform and nothing else, which leaves
 * a hard rectangular edge with no corner, no border and no shadow - a cropped
 * screenshot rather than a surface being edited. This is the chrome around it:
 * the blurred backdrop, the corner, the drop shadow and the edge, as one
 * component so the four cannot end up a pixel apart from each other or from the
 * desktop. Everything geometric comes from `card`, which is
 * `edit_mode.js`'s `cardRect` - the same arithmetic the transform is built out
 * of - for the reason ClockDepthCutout is one component: a second copy of a
 * registration drifts, and the drift is invisible because both copies look
 * plausible.
 *
 * ---- why the backdrop is drawn ON TOP of the desktop -----------------------
 *
 * The desktop is three sibling items, each carrying the edit transform, and QML
 * has no rounded clip: there is no property on any of them that rounds a
 * corner, and wrapping all three in one masked layer means re-rendering the
 * wallpaper through an effect for every frame of the shrink.
 *
 * So the corner is made by covering it with what is behind it, which is this
 * same blurred picture. The backdrop draws above the desktop and is cut out to
 * the card's rounded rect, which is visually identical to drawing it behind
 * everywhere except the four corners - and at the corners it is the difference
 * between a rounded card and a square one. It also puts the shadow where a
 * shadow belongs: inside the same cut-out, over the backdrop, so only the half
 * of it outside the card survives and its interior never darkens the desktop it
 * is supposed to lift.
 *
 * What it costs is one full-screen layer and one mask, re-rendered while the
 * card's geometry moves - the 400ms of an entry or an exit, and never at rest.
 * The blur itself is not re-run for the chrome's sake: it is the same
 * WallpaperBlurBackdrop that was already being drawn, and it already re-renders
 * on a live Wallpaper Engine wallpaper whatever this does.

    // difference between an object with an edge and an object with a border
    // drawn round it.
    //
    // Fractional is the normal case, not the exception. The card is a screen
    // scaled to fit a room measured in whole pixels, so its width is

    // rounding the mask alone is worse than the seam it fixes: a mask on a

    // ---- the glass edge ---------------------------------------------------
    //
    // ONE tone, one pixel wide, and mostly not there. That is a correction of
    // this file's own previous answer rather than a tuning of it.
    //
    // The card used to end at a 1px colLayer0Border line, which is the shell's
    // outline for a floating surface and is right for a panel sitting on a
    // surface this file's own tokens were derived from. Over a WALLPAPER it is
    // a drawn line rather than an edge, so it was replaced by a bevel in three
    // tones: a 4px shade band outside the card, a 2px specular on the edge, and
    // a 1px highlight inside it. Each tone was defensible and the sum was a
    // BORDER - measured on the real desktop at 5120x1440, walking inward across
    // the left flank: backdrop 28, shade 17, 17, specular 77, 77, highlight
    // 128, desktop 105. Five drawn pixels of dark-then-bright piping, at one
    // strength the whole way round a 3872px card. Which is what "edit mode's
    // layout having this thick border is what looked ugly" names.
    //
    // What the three tones were each solving, and why none of them survives:
    //
    //   - the shade band gave the card a lip so the edge carried over a bright
    //     picture. `StyledRectangularShadow` below is already a darkening
    //     outside the card, from the same lamp, and it is the one the
    //     maintainer says is right. Two darkenings outside one edge is the
    //     shade band drawing a hard 2px copy of the soft one under it.
    //   - the inner highlight gave the specular a near side. It is a uniform
    //     line at the card's edge that composites over the DESKTOP, so it is
    //     the brightest thing on the boundary on three edges out of four (+24
    //     to +41 levels wherever it lands) - structurally the same object as
    //     the colLayer0Border outline removed in 1df616e62, in white.
    //   - the specular is the one that is really an edge: a catch where the
    //     light hits. It stays, at `standard` rather than `emphasis` width,
    //     and its flank drops to a value that is nearly nothing rather than to
    //     a value that is merely less.
    //
    // Glass is not a ring of even thickness. It is a bright catch along the top
    // and the corner arcs and almost nothing along the rest; what carries its
    // presence is the shadow around it, not a drawn perimeter. The shadow is
    // already there, so the edge does not have to prove the card exists.
    //
    // The two divide the perimeter between them rather than doubling up on it,
    // and that is a property of the shadow rather than a hope: it carries
    // `offset: (0, 1)`, so it is at its weakest directly above the card and at
    // its strongest below. Measured over this library's brightest wallpaper, the
    // backdrop falls 172 -> 158 above the card and 237 -> 146 below it, which is
    // the opposite ordering to the catch (0.44 at the top, 0.13 at the bottom).
    // The boundary is a bright line where the shade is thin and a pool of shade
    // where the line is not there.
    //
    // It costs nothing extra: a plain Rectangle declared inside `surround`,
    // whose layer is already masked to the complement of the card - so the mask
    // cuts it down to the band outside the card by itself, and the shading is
    // the Rectangle's own gradient. No second layer, no second mask, and
    // nothing re-rendering the backdrop, which is the cost this whole component
    // is arranged to avoid.

    // bands either side of it, and went in 1df616e62. Then a 1px
    // `colGlassSpecular` highlight at 0.16, on the reasoning that the specular
    // needs a near side or it is a line balanced on the seam.

    // The second is the first wearing the other colour. It cannot ride
    // `surround`'s mask - it is inside the card, which is exactly what that mask
    // removes - so it is a uniform border rather than a shaded band, drawn at
    // one strength round all 9922px of a 3872x1089 perimeter, compositing over
    // the DESKTOP rather than over the backdrop. Measured on the real desktop it
    // was the brightest thing on the boundary on three edges out of four: +41
    // levels over a wallpaper at 105 on the left flank, +35 over one at 36 along
    // the top. A line that is brighter than the specular it is supposedly
    // supporting is the edge, and a line of even thickness all the way round is
    // a border.
    //
    // docs/M3_GUIDELINES.md §1 is what licenses the absence: "visible borders
    // are not required for every surface". The job the guideline gives an
    // outline - defining edges against complex backgrounds - belongs here to the
    // shadow and to the specular's catch, and both of those already vary round
    // the perimeter the way a real edge does.
