/**
 * Where the quality gate lives, and it is a human - so this is the instrument
 * it makes its decision with.
 *
 * There is no automatic check for whether a mask is good. Scoring the whole
 * library numerically ranked rectangular slabs of background ABOVE clean
 * cutouts, and even the right model produces an unusable mask about a third of
 * the time it produces one at all - so depth is not an automatic effect, it is a
 * per-wallpaper artifact the user accepts once, with segmentation proposing
 * candidates.
 *
 * Two detectors, because neither is a superset of the other: `isnet-anime`
 * carries most of this library and returns nothing at all on the
 * semi-photographic minority that `isnet-general-use` handles best. So a model
 * that finds nothing usually means the WRONG MODEL rather than no subject -
 * measured on `cat_upscayl_2x…png`, where the illustration model returns `none`
 * and the photographic one returns a foreground of 0.143 - and the two are
 * shown side by side, at the same size, for exactly that reason.
 *
 * A THIRD column, because on this library "the wrong model" is usually still
 * the answer after trying both: swept over the 94 wallpapers here, 45 return
 * nothing from either detector and 3 have never been run. Those are not empty pictures - they are
 * landscapes and full-bleed illustrations with plenty to stand in front of a
 * clock and no single salient object to find. That column is MobileSAM and it
 * answers a different question: not "what is the subject of this picture" but
 * "what is the thing at this point". So the user points at it.
 *
 * That column is NOT clicked here. The gesture used to live on this preview and
 * it was the wrong surface for it: the mask is judged at screen size against
 * real widgets and was being authored against a ~300px thumbnail, where a click
 * landing on a character's shoulder is several hundred pixels off by the time
 * anyone sees the result - and a mis-aimed click comes back as a perfectly good
 * mask of the wrong thing. Selecting happens on the desktop itself
 * (modules/imi/clockDepthSelect), on the wallpaper as it is actually drawn, and
 * this column is the way in and the record of what came back: the clicks are
 * drawn on as plus and minus discs, and the cutout they produced sits under
 * them.
 *
 * All three columns are the same width, which is the point of the layout: the
 * cutouts are being compared, and the clickable one is not more important than
 * the two it is being compared against.
 *
 * The preview is composited the way the desktop is - the wallpaper cropped as it
 * will be, with a clock over it and the cutout on top - rather than shown as a
 * bare mask. A bare cutout hides the failure that matters: the depth layer
 * paints the wallpaper's own pixels back over themselves, so a wrong mask costs
 * nothing where no widget sits, and the only question is whether it is right
 * where the clock is.
 *
 * INSPECT is the other half, and it is the half that was missing: at full
 * brightness a soft edge, a halo and a rectangular slab of background are all
 * invisible against the image they were cut from - that is §1.2's own finding,
 * which is why the feasibility survey judged every candidate as a cutout over a
 * flat field rather than over its wallpaper. Switching it on dims everything
 * the model did NOT claim and traces the silhouette, so the three questions a
 * verdict actually rests on - where is the edge, how soft is it, what did it
 * grab that it should not have - are answerable by looking. It draws over the
 * SAME registered mask surface the desktop layer masks with (see
 * ClockDepthCutout), so it cannot show a registration the desktop does not use.
