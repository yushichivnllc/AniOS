## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/pvtoari/grubphemous-theme

    cd grubphemous-theme
    ```

2.  **Run the installation script with sudo**:

    The script will prompt you to choose a background and copy the theme files to the appropriate GRUB themes directory.
    ```bash
    sudo ./install_theme.sh
    ```
    This script attempts to copy the theme to `/boot/grub/themes/grubphemous` or `/boot/grub2/themes/grubphemous`.

3.  **Configure GRUB**:
    Edit your GRUB configuration file (usually `/etc/default/grub`) using a text editor:
    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/default/grub
    ```
    Locate the `GRUB_THEME=` line. If it exists, modify it. If not, add the line. Set it as follows:
    ```ini
    GRUB_THEME="/boot/grub/themes/grubphemous/theme.txt"
    ```
    (If your GRUB directory is `/boot/grub2`, adjust the path to `/boot/grub2/themes/grubphemous/theme.txt`)

4.  **Update GRUB Configuration, e.g.:**
    ```bash
    sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
    ```

## Customization

By default, the background image is provided by `grubphemous/background.png` and set during installation, but if you want to set a different background, you can add your own PNG image to the `background/` directory before running the installation script, or you can change it later manually in the theme's folder e.g.,  `/boot/grub/themes/grubphemous`.

### Background Image

* The `install_theme.sh` script will offer to run the background selection utility during installation.
* You can change the background at any time by running the [`choose_background.sh`](/home/pvtoari/repos/grubphemous-theme/choose_background.sh) script directly from the repo directory:
    ```bash
    ./choose_background.sh
    ```
    After selecting a new background, you will need to re-copy the theme to your GRUB themes directory, or manually copy the updated `grubphemous/background.png` file.

* Alternatively, you can manually replace the `grubphemous/background.png` file within the theme's source directory with your desired PNG image and then copy the `grubphemous` folder to `/boot/grub/themes/` (or `/boot/grub2/themes/`).

## TODO
- ~~If possible, add a children of the moonlight cursor at the right of the selection item (like the one in the game)~~ implemented by [@sergoncano](https://github.com/sergoncano), thank you!
- Improve compatibility with other resolutions
